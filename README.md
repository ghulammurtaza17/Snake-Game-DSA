# 🐍 Snake Game using C++ and BFS Pathfinding

This project is a console-based Snake Game implemented in **C++**, showcasing important **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. The game supports:

- ✅ Manual mode (WASD control)
- 🤖 Auto mode using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for pathfinding
- ⛔ Obstacles avoidance
- 📦 Linked List for snake body
- 🧠 Queue and BFS for shortest path navigation

---

## 📌 Features

- Manual Mode (W/A/S/D to control the snake)
- Auto Mode (AI uses BFS to move toward the fruit)
- Obstacles randomly generated on the grid
- Dynamic snake growth on fruit consumption
- Collision detection (walls, self, obstacles)

---

## 🧠 DSA Concepts Covered

- ✅ **Linked List** – dynamic snake body
- ✅ **Queue** – BFS implementation
- ✅ **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** – shortest path finding
- ✅ **Grid-based movement** and state traversal
- ✅ **Pointer Manipulation** and memory allocation
